This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description>
## Redis on Windows 

- This is a port for Windows based on [Redis](https://github.com/antirez/redis).
- We officially support the 64-bit version only. Although you can build the 32-bit version from source if desired.
- You can download the latest unsigned binaries and the unsigned MSI installer from the [release page](http://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases "Release page").
- For releases prior to 2.8.17.1, the binaries can found in a zip file inside the source archive, under the bin/release folder.
- Signed binaries are available through [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Redis-64/) and [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/redis-64).
- Redis can be installed as a Windows Service.

## Windows-specific changes
- There is a replacement for the UNIX fork() API that simulates the copy-on-write behavior using a memory mapped file on 2.8. Version 3.0 is using a similar behavior but dropped the memory mapped file in favor of the system paging file.
- In 3.0 we switch the default memory allocator from dlmalloc to jemalloc that is supposed to do a better job at managing the heap fragmentation.
- Because Redis makes some assumptions about the values of file descriptors, we have built a virtual file descriptor mapping layer.
